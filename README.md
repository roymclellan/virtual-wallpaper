# Virtual Wallpaper
A Virtual Wallpaper to replace the boring desktop wallpapers set by the admin team at Epiq.

## Instructions

### Installation

Installation can be accomplished by visiting the Virtual Wallpaper Releases page (found [here](https://github.com/roymclellan/virtual-wallpaper/releases)) and downloading, then running the latest wallpaper-setup executable file.

### Updating

The app has an auto-updating feature, and will automatically check for updates each time it is started.  If you do not want to initiate an update at the particular time, simply ignore the update message, and the update will occur the next time the app starts.  If you want to check for updates while the app is running, click "About" --> "Check for Updates".

### Using the App

#### Making Selections

* **Folder** - This is a directory containing .jpg images, preferably in the resolution 1920x1080.  Other image sizes are not currently supported.  
* **Count** - You must select between 1 and 4 wallpapers to be launched.  Creating new wallpaper windows will not close existing windows.
* **Time** - Increments between 5-seconds (not recommended) and 30 minutes.  This represents the amount of time an image remains displayed on a single wallpaper window.

#### Showing Wallpapers

The 'Show Wallpapers' button allows you to launch 1-4 wallpaper windows, either directly from the selection controls, or using stored preferences.  If the user has preference saved, the "Use Prefs" toggle will be enabled and will launch whatever preferences were stored.  If the toggle, (though enabled) is turned off, or the toggle is not enabled at all, the button will launch windows according to the preferences set below.

#### Static Wallpaper

The Static Wallpaper button allows you to launch a single wallpaper with an image that doesn't change.  Use this if you have that one favorite image you just want there all the time.  Static Wallpapers cannot be added to preferences, and an image must be selected each time.

#### Taskbar Options

Once the main app window is minimized, or wallpapers have been created using the "Show Wallpapers" button, the app disappears to the taskbar tray.  Here you are given several options:

1. **Show App** - This brings the app back into focus, allowing you to make changes to your wallpaper selections.
1. **Quick Wallpaper** - Launches a single rotating-image wallpaper using the user's stored preferences for library and rotation time.
1. **Quit** - Close all wallpaper windows and exit the app.
